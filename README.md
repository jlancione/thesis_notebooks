# Classifying electroweak boson decays with a neural network at LHC
## Undergraduate thesis project

In these jupyter notebooks there is the code developed as an undergraduate thesis project at Universit√† di Torino (University of Turin), where I have tackled two binary classification problems one for each of the electroweak bosons, Z and W.

The datasets contain measurements of events at CMS/CERN from Run2011A

The `.csv` files in the folder `input_datasets` were downloaded from kaggle:
- [Z decays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omidbaghchehsaraei/identification-of-two-modes-of-z-boson/data)
- [W electron decays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omidbaghchehsaraei/cern-dataset-w-to-electron-and-neutrino)
- [W muon decays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omidbaghchehsaraei/cern-dataset-w-to-muon-and-neutrino)

In the Presentation folder there are the slides (written in LaTeX and compiled with `pdflatex`) shown during the thesis defence held in Nov 2024
